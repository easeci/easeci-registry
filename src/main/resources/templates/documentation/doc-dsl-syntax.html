            Here you can find Easefile syntax explanation.
            The Easefile file format is a equivalent of the YAML style.
            In this article, we will describe the syntax of EaseDsl format.

        <div class="rule">
            <h1>Directives and '$' character</h1>
            <p>
                We have marked the directives in blue. The directive calls the EaseCI Core functionality.
                We can use directives to call built-in functions in the application and the features that are provided by plugins.
                Each directive call must be preceded by the dollar sign '$'.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h1>Variables</h1>
            <p>
                We use standard variables definition, using the ':' sign.
                We recommend using python-style notation with '_' as the word separator.
                Variables must be defined after the 'variables' keyword. We can use this keyword anywhere in Easefile.
                Variables could be global or local. Define variables keyword before some stage to make this variables global,
                or define variables keyword in specific stage to encapsulate ones.

                                Then project will have projectId that you can use here in <span class="property minor">projectId</span> property.

                    The <span class="property minor">'flow:'</span> component is the most important part of Easefile because it defines all steps, to perform during Pipeline startup.
                    You can write a sequence of steps starting by fetching the source code from the Git server, then compiling the project and
                    deliver a ready, production version for servers in the production environment.
                    At each step, we must use directives that are preceded by the '$' sign.
                    Thanks to that we refer to a specific part of the system or an externally delivered component called 'Performer'.
                    Performer will provide appropriate instructions that the EaseCI engine will execute in the isolated application container.
                    In the official documentation, you can only find descriptions for the default Performers.
                    For performers delivered by independent developers, documentation is available at the website listed in the Performer file repository.

                    <span class="property minor">flow</span> is simple list of stages. Building flow is extremely simple.
                    <span class="property minor">Flow</span> is just a list of objects - that we call <span class="property minor">stage</span>
                    The order of execution of tasks (stages) will be the same as the order of objects in the flow list.
                    <span class="property minor">Flow</span> can declare any number of stages.
